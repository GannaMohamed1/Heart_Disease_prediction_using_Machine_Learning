## Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using six machine learning models (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest). The dataset is preprocessed with
one-hot encoding and min-max normalization, achieving 87% accuracy with the Naive Bayes classifier. Features include data exploration, model benchmarking, and performance evaluation 
to identify optimal algorithms for clinical risk assessment.
